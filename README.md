## ðŸ’» Using it in a RageUI

- Import this resource in `fxmanifest.lua`
```lua
dependancies {
    "player_statut"
}
```
- Call events
```lua
RageUI.Button("~y~Kick", nil, {}, true, {
    onSelected = function()
        KeyboardInput("Motif du kick :", "", 128, function()
            TriggerServerEvent("player_statut:kickPlayer", selectedPlayer)
        end)
    end
})
```

You can create as many events as you want directly on the `server.lua` in this resource and call them in your scripts to trigger the game text.
